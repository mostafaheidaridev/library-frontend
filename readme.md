## ðŸ”— API

We use this backend API:  
[https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_library_api_v3](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_library_api_v3)  
The data comes from an SQLite database and covers books, authors, publishers, and users.

- Only uses HTML, CSS (with variables), and JavaScript
- Mobile-first, fully responsive design
